	C# and .NET Framework

	.NET is mainly known as library but it is also runtime for executing applications.
	C# implies some knowledge from .NET, as their object models correspond. C sharp however
	is not the only language you can write, .NET applications, with. The implementation of C#
	from microsoft is heavily integrated with the .NET Framework and it is understandable
	the two concepts can be mistaken, but they are completely different.
